		<b>Lalvin 71B-1122 / Gervin Varietal 'D' / Vintners Harvest MA33</b><br>
		<i>Common shorthand: 71B</i><br>
		This will work well for almost all white wines. Brings out the fruit flavours. Great for "Wine No.1". Especially useful for stoned fruit wines as it can metabolise some (up to 40%) of the harsher malic acid present, giving you a smoother wine.
		<br><br>
		<b>Lalvin ICV-D47 / Gervin Varietal 'F' / Vintners Harvest CY17</b><br>
		<i>Common shorthand: D47</i><br>
		Good for whites, and generally recommended for rosés too. Fine for "Wine No.1" and ideal for "Wine No.2".
		<br><br>
		<b>Lalvin K1V-1116 / Gervin Varietal 'E' / <i>Vintners equivalent not known</i></b><br>
		<i>Common shorthand: K1V</i><br>
		A great swiss-army-knife yeast, works well in whites, reds, and everything in between. Generally bullet-proof, it will sedately but thoroughly ferment anything in its path, and produces fruity whites and reds. Often recommended for meads.
		<br><br>
		<b>Lalvin EC-1118 / Gervin No.3 / Vintners Harvest CL23</b><br>
		A good all-purpose yeast which will ferment virtually anything, but is a little bit harder on the wine and has a tendency to strip flavour. If you ever get a stuck fermentation this is the yeast of choice to get you out of trouble. Keep a sachet in your cupboard!
		<br><br>
		<b>Lalvin RC212 / <i>Gervin & Vintners equivalents not known</i></b><br>
		This is a dedicated red wine yeast. You will almost certainly need to use a good yeast nutrient with this. Tends to produce 'darker' tasting reds (as opposed to K1V, which brings out the fruity character).
