#TODO

##Required for v2.0.0:

- Rebuild gui framework in JavaFX 8
- Add tests (TestFX?)
- Make sure gui works with high DPI
- Output build artefacts to somewhere from travis-ci? (maybe)
- Look at warnings
- Refactor code to use decent coding standards ;)
- Fix bugs
- Fix unicode characters
- Sort out deprecated method usage on itextpdf
- Check for updates on startup (config to make it go away)
- Sort out image scaling for highdpi (support both)
- figure out why buttons move slightly on first load after clicking, padding?
- some sort of backup of database
